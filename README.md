# React With Native

## Why?

1. To solve react-native-web's severe limitations.
2. To share 90% of your cosebase between your next.js app and react native app but still have the full functionality of Next.js and React Native while keeping their bundles as small as possible.
3. To provide an easy way to extend your React (Next.js) app so it can also be rendered in React Native.
4. Because most companies come from the react side and want an app later, not the other way around.

React with Native has been built with [sensible](https://sensiblestack.com). To start developing:

- run `yarn dev` to watch all package changes & open the dev dashboard.
- run `yarn start:label`, where label can be one of `app`, `docs`, `server`, or `web` depending on what you are developing
