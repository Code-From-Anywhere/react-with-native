Test nonsense init

What else can I prepare to blow **AI Heroes** mind? ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ And everyone after them..?

- Ask what kind of prototype they'd like to create before the demo
- Create "Sensible Steps" markdown document (especially for the demo purpose) to open this at the ipad
- Try a demo where I make a full-stack app and deploy it (they should be able to see it on their phones and website)
- **If I got enough time**: make server with two databases: json-orm and sequelize. Create small POC for `sensible model` that creates a CRUD. Also use the VSCode Extension in the demo, if it works well.
- Make sure I record the whole demo so it can be seen by other Dutch companies.
