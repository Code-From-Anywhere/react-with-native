# TODAY

- add User model with signup, login/logout and Message CRD

- Provide good in-code instructions as well in the DEMO code so people can easily learn everything
- Copy react-with-native/ui to sensible/templates/base/packages/ui (make sure to remind myself of this using code comments and/or readme)
- Base codefromanywhere full-stack section on the DEMO, since everything is explained there. Make sure to document well how to add screens to next.js apps

- fix android build expo
- Test sensible init and see how easy it is to create a POC, see what else can be prepared for demoing this.
- build apk and add to assets so people can install this demo to test (simple install button)
