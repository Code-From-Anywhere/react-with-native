- [ ] Docusaurus for react-with-native, use same frontpage as we had
- [ ] Start with getting all readmes from git and placing them in docusaurus, linking to there
- [ ] Then make very good docs for rwn-form especially
- [ ] Improve rwn-select
- [ ] Create rwn-select-multiple-input that selects one per time using rwn-select and adds the results to an Item[]
- [ ] Create rwn-multiple-input that lets you type and every time you press comma the input becomes a box you can delete. returns string[]
- [ ] Create overarching repo for react-with-native-form-inputs in case you want to use our inputs to make that easier. No need for these small packages
- [ ] Have a look at the imports. Is that allright?
