# TODAY

- Sensible/RWN Docs: Provide instructions to run it locally so you can test it on any platform
- Sensible/RWN Docs: Have links to the code on docs pages for when people want to internalise the code
- Provide good in-code instructions as well in the DEMO code so people can easily learn everything
- Provide links to the code on every demo page (navigates to https://github.com/Code-From-Anywhere/react-with-native/tree/main/packages/ui/src/pages/\*.tsx). Add iframe to show github code next to the examples on every page. This would be very nice to learn. Only on big screens, otherwise just link to code.
- Copy react-with-native/ui to sensible/templates/base/packages/ui (make sure to remind myself of this somehow)
- Base codefromanywhere full-stack section on the DEMO, since everything is explained there. Make sure to document well how to add screens to next.js apps
